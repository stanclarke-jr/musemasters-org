## Overview

YouTube is a rabbithole of videos. Learning to play an instrument on YouTube can be overwhelming.

Distracting, unrelated videos are right around the corner. MuseMasters curates music lesson videos based on custom search queries. Music lessons in one place, on a separate community-oriented platform to facilitate learning.

### The Details

Users are able to watch videos without the need to log in. In the future they will be able to like videos, comment on them, submit suggestions, as well as view their saved videos. However, to do so they *will* need to be logged in. User authentication is done with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and bcrypt.js to encrypt passwords. All data is stored in MongoDB. Images are stored on Cloudinary.
